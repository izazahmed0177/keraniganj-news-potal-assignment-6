                <h2>1.Difference between var, let and const keywords in JavaScript ?</h2>
                <p>
                    A variable declaration is simply telling the computer that a variable exists and what value it
                    should start with. Similar to other programming languages JavaScript also allows for the declaration
                    of variables.

                    There are three keywords in JavaScript that can be used to declare variables: let, var, and const.
                    Each keyword has different rules and implications for how the variables they create can be used.<br>

                    1.let: The let keyword declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a
                    value.
                    Block-scoped means that the variable is only available within the block it was declared in, which is
                    usually denoted by curly braces {}. <br>

                    2.var: The var keyword declares a function-scoped or global variable, optionally initializing it to
                    a value.
                    Function-scoped means that the variable is only available within the function it was declared in.
                    Global variables are available throughout your entire code. <br>

                    3.const: The const keyword declares a block-scoped, immutable constant variable, i.e. a variable
                    that can't be reassigned.
                    Constants are also called “immutable variables”, but that's a bit of a misnomer since they are
                    actually variables - just ones that can't be reassigned.
                </p>

                <h2>2.Difference Between Arrow Function and Regular Function ?</h2>
                <p>An arrow function is also known as the fat arrow function. It is a new feature introduced in ES6 that
                    is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. Both regular JavaScript functions and
                    arrow functions work in a similar manner but there are some differences between them. <br> Let's see
                    the
                    differences below: -</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Syntax</li>
                    <li>Arguments binding</li>
                    <li>Use of this keyword</li>
                    <li>Using a new keyword</li>

                </ul>
                <h4>1) Syntax:</h4>
                <p>A programmer can get the same result as regular functions by writing a few lines of code using arrow
                    functions.</p>
                <p>Curly brackets are not required if only one expression is present.</p>
                <div class="text-success">
                    // Regular function ES5: br
                    var add = function(a, b) { return a + b;};
                    <br>
                    // Arrow function ES6
                    <br>
                    let add = (a, b) => { return a + b};
                    <br>
                    //or
                    <br>
                    let add = (a, b) => a + b;
                </div>

                <h4>2) Arguments binding</h4>
                <p> object inside the regular functions contains the list of arguments.</p>
                <div class="text-success">
                    // Object with Regular function
                    <br>
                    let showData = {
                    <br>
                    showArg: function(){
                    <br>
                    console.log(arguments);
                    <br>
                    }
                    <br>
                    }
                    <br>
                    showData.showArg(1,2,3);
                    <br> // output {0:1,1:2,2:3}
                </div>

                <p>The arrow function, on the opposite, doesn't define arguments i.e. they do not have arguments
                    binding.</p>
                <div class="text-success">

                    // Object with Arrow function
                    <br>
                    let showData = {
                    <br>
                    showArg: ()=>console.log(arguments);
                    <br>
                    }
                    <br>
                    showData.showArg(1,2,3);
                    <br>
                    // Uncaught ReferenceError: arguments is not defined
                </div>

                <p>But you can easily access the arrow function arguments using a rest parameter ...args.</p>
                <div class="text-success">
                    // using rest parameters
                    <br>
                    let showData = {
                    <br>
                    showArg: (...args)=>console.log(args);
                    <br>
                    }
                    <br>
                    myFunc.showArgs(1, 2, 3, 4); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
                </div>

                <h4>3) Use of this keyword</h4>
                <p>Inside of a regular JavaScript function, this value is dynamic. The dynamic context means that the
                    value of this depends on how the function is invoked.</p>
                <p>The behavior of this inside of an arrow, function differs considerably from the regular function’s
                    this behavior as an arrow function does not have its own “this” keyword.
                    <br>
                    The value of this inside an arrow function remains the same throughout the lifecycle of the function
                    and is always bound to the value of this in the closest non-arrow parent function which means No
                    matter how or where being executed, this value inside of an arrow function always equals this value
                    from the outer function.
                </p>

                <h4>4) Using a new keyword</h4>
                <p>Regular functions are constructible and callable. They can be called using the new keyword.</p>

                <p>But, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e., arrow functions can never be
                    used as constructor functions.</p>

            <div class="container text-bg-light p-5">
                <h2>3.Difference between forEach, map and filter, find ?</h2>
                <p>Array functions are something that can help you with any type of manipulation or looping through an
                    array of items in JavaScript. Some of the pre-built functions can have very similar use cases to one
                    another, therefore I have created a list of manipulation functions, with how they look and their use
                    cases.</p>

                <h4>1 .forEach()</h4>
                <p>Function .forEach() is another form of just a plain for loop that can be used to iterate through
                    array items. This case of a function is used for more complex arrays, for example, an array of
                    objects with a lot of entries than just an array of integers.
                    <br>
                    This function takes 1 parameter .forEach(callback). The parameter callback can take up to 3
                    parameters element, index & array (but only the element parameter is required, the rest is
                    optional).
                    <br>
                    The parameter element will be used as a variable that stores the current element in the array.
                    Parameter index refers to the element's index in the array and the parameter array points to the
                    array that it was called on.
                    <br>
                    I do have to say that the newer prebuilt loop for..of in JavaScript is way more efficient than the
                    .forEach() in code clarity and its performance.
                </p>
                <h4>2 .map()</h4>
                <p>Function .map() is a manipulative function that can modify each element's content in an array that it
                    is called on. This function returns a new array with modified values, the array that it is called on
                    will stay still. This function is useful for adding a little change to an already existing array,
                    for example adding a property to an object or modifying it. Its construction and use are identical
                    to the previous function .forEach() and both can be used interchangeably.
                    <br>
                    Just like the function .forEach(), this function also takes only 1 parameter .map(callback). The
                    parameter callback can take up to 3 parameters element, index & array (but only the element
                    parameter is required, the rest is optional).
                </p>

                <h4>3 .filter()</h4>
                <p>
                    Function .filter() is a search function that returns all the elements that fulfil the assigned
                    condition. You can search by simple terms, for example, that element is equal to a certain integer,
                    or by more advanced terms, for example, searching for an object with certain property that is equal
                    to something. Both examples have a very frequent use as a developer.
                    <br>
                    This function returns an array of found results, if any, even if only 1 match is found. If a
                    function does not find any match, it simply returns an empty array.
                    <br>
                    Just like the function .forEach(), this function also takes only 1 parameter .filter(callback). The
                    parameter callback can take up to 3 parameters element, index & array (but only the element
                    parameter is required, the rest is optional).
                </p>

                <h4>4 .find()</h4>
                <p>Function .find() is also a search function like the previous but they differ in one small detail —
                    this function returns only one match in an array. If in an array is more than one result, the
                    function will return the first that has matched.
                    <br>
                    Just like the function .forEach(), this function also takes only 1 parameter .find(callback). The
                    parameter callback can take up to 3 parameters element, index & array (but only the element
                    parameter is required, the rest is optional).
                </p>

                <h2>4. Why we use template string in javascript ?</h2>

                <p>Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us
                    insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in
                    older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic
                    elements. Another great thing that comes with template strings are tags. Tags are functions that
                    take a string and the decomposed parts of the string as parameters and are great for converting
                    strings to different entities.
                    <br>
                    The syntax for creating template strings is by using backticks to delimit them. For example, we can
                    write:
                    <br>
                    <span class="text-success">`This is a string`</span>

                    <br>
                    This is a very simple example of a template string. All the content is constant and there are no
                    variables or expressions in it. To add variables and or expressions to a string, we can do the
                    following.
